        <h2>Range Sustainment</h2>
        <p>HIES maintains active Department of Defense's training ranges and facilities, and conducts baseline assessments in accordance to Range Environment Vulnerability Program (REVA).</p> 
        <p>Utilizing GIS, geological, and natural resource data, HIES is able to maintain the viability and utility of land currently in use. Range conditions, environmental sampling, and remedial designs are administered.</p>
        <p>With company offices in Hawaii, California, Colorado, Guam, Japan, and Okinawa, HIES is strategically positioned to support DoD and commercial clients.</p>
        <p>For most active military training ranges, maintenance closure for de-leading curtails valuable national security training. Fortunately, HIESâ€™s specially-trained heavy equipment operators, remediation specialists, and environmental engineers has created a proven system to drastically reduce de-leading and earthen berm rebuilding times, drastically reducing costs and range closure time.</p>

        <h2>Military Munitions Response</h2>
        <p>HIES offers technical support to government participants in the EPA regulated program for assessing hazards for munitions response sites. All staff are trained & qualified in emergency response and hazardous materials handling.</p>
        <p>HIES MEC/MC (Munitions & Explosives of Concern/Munitions Constituents) characterization & clearance group consists of former DoD UXO PM, UXO Safety, and QC assurance personnel. Management and safety process complies with guidelines under Osha, CERCLA, COE EM-385, and DoD protocols.</p>
        <p>Using strict engineering and quality control guidelines, HIES specialists have streamlined the surveys, remediation, and clearance process to reduce human risks associated with MEC/MC.</p>

        <h2>Direct Melting Systems</h2>
        <p>HIES Melting Technology originates from steel manufacturing plants, capable of processing a wide range of waste into useful material, generating energy, and without poisonous byproduct.</p>
        <p>The melting technology melts various types of waste such as sewage sludge, landfill reclamation waste, clinical waste, waste tires, and asbestos, without the need of pre-treatment.</p>
        <p>What returns is a high-quality yet slag and inert metal, capable of being repurposed into the market for secondary materials such as concrete, cinderblocks, pavement and asphalt. Most recently, this after material has been recycled for application as fertilizers, marine blocks, and scrap for steel production.</p>
        <p>Direct Melting Technology is a step toward the Zero Waste concept.</p>
